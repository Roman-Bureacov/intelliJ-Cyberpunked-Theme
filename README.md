# intelliJ-Cyberpunked-Theme
A cyberpunk 2077 theme for the intelliJ IDE

If you find any Magentas (#FF00FF) please to report them. During development, it was difficult to find what components were colored by what keys. If you find magenta, it means you found a component that uses a key that I didn't find.

So far a bit of a beta release. To run the theme:

1. Go to `Deployment` and install the corresponding `.jar`.
