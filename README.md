# intelliJ-Cyberpunked-Theme
A cyberpunk 2077 theme for the intelliJ IDE

If you find any Magentas (#FF00FF) please to report them. During development, it was difficult to find what components were colored by what keys. If you find magenta, it means you found a component that uses a key that I didn't find.
