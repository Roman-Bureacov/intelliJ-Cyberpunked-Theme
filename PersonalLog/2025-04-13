Figured out the colors. Yesterday I found something quite curious:

MenuItem.acceleratorSelectionForeground is deprecated, it suggests to use MenuItem.selectionForeground instead,
and yet that doesn't actually change the accelerator colors. The note says "not used" and yet it very well looks
like it IS used.

Today I also uncovered another thing, some of the keys are not actually registered. I've had trouble finding the
key for the MainMenu.foreground, as it does not show up in the autocomplete, and typing it out says warns it's
an unrecognized key. Oddly enough, it IS an existing key and does actually change the menu bar foreground
