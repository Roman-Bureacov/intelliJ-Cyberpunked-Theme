Okay, so this is a really strange bug.

Inspection of documentation leads to magenta around in-line code.

Changing the "colorDebug" to another color does not affect the in-line code of the documentation.

So now I am stuck with a misbehaving API for some reason. Changing keys does not change the magenta ???
